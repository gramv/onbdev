# ✅ Rejection Issue - Final Fix Complete

## 🎯 Issue Resolved

The rejection functionality is now working correctly. The 422 errors were caused by trying to reject applications that either:
1. **Don't exist** - Application IDs that are no longer in the system
2. **Already processed** - Applications that are no longer in "pending" status
3. **Wrong property** - Applications that don't belong to the manager's property

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ **Backend Endpoint Working**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /applications/{application_id}/reject`
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Test Result**: 200 OK with talent pool integration

### 2. ✅ **Fresh Test Data Created**
Created 3 new pending applications for testing:
- **Alice TestReject1** (Front Desk Agent) - ID: `a3d09773-607a-404b-b537-113af346226c`
- **Bob TestReject2** (Housekeeper) - ID: `d4e667f7-5588-4b5e-b0db-ad87dd4158ae`
- **Carol TestReject3** (Server) - ID: `523d8381-c122-4a5a-a007-f306ae794f1a`

### 3. ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**
Updated frontend to provide specific error messages:
- **422 Error**: "Invalid application data. The application may have already been processed."
- **404 Error**: "Application not found. It may have been deleted or processed by another user."
- **403 Error**: "Access denied. You may not have permission to reject this application."

### 4. ✅ **Talent Pool Integration**
- Rejected applications automatically move to talent pool
- Talent pool notification emails sent
- Applications can be reactivated from talent pool
