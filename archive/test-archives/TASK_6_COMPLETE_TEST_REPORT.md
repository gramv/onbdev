## 📝 Implementation Details

### 1. API Endpoint Updates ✅

**Before:**
```typescript
// Property info
const response = await axios.get(`http://127.0.0.1:8000/properties/${propertyId}`)

// Application submission  
await axios.post(`http://127.0.0.1:8000/applications/${propertyId}/submit`, formData)
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Property info
const response = await axios.get(`http://127.0.0.1:8000/properties/${propertyId}/info`)

// Application submission
await axios.post(`http://127.0.0.1:8000/apply/${propertyId}`, formData)
```

### 2. Data Model Updates ✅

**Added PropertyInfo Interface:**
```typescript
interface PropertyInfo {
  property: Property
  departments_and_positions: Record<string, string[]>
  application_url: string
  is_accepting_applications: boolean
}
```

**Fixed Field Names:**
- `zip` → `zip_code` (backend compatibility)
- Updated form state to use `propertyInfo` instead of direct `property`

### 3. Form Field Updates ✅

**Employment Type Options:**
- Added "temporary" option
- Changed values to `full_time`, `part_time`, `temporary`

**Experience Years Options:**
- Updated to `0-1`, `2-5`, `6-10`, `10+` (matches backend validation)

**Shift Preference Options:**
- Added "afternoon" option
- Now includes: morning, afternoon, evening, night, flexible

**Department Integration:**
- Form now uses `propertyInfo.departments_and_positions` from backend
- Departments: Front Desk, Housekeeping, Food & Beverage, Maintenance
- Positions dynamically loaded based on selected department
