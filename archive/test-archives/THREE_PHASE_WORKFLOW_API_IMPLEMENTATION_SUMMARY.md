# Three-Phase Workflow API Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the missing APIs for the three-phase onboarding workflow (Employee → Manager → HR) in the backend system. The implementation includes comprehensive error handling, role-based access control, audit logging, and email notifications.

## Implemented APIs

### 1. Manager Review APIs

#### GET /api/manager/onboarding/{session_id}/review
- **Purpose**: Retrieve onboarding session for manager review
- **Access**: Manager role required, must be assigned to the session
- **Returns**: Session details, employee data, form data, documents, and next steps
- **Validation**: Checks session exists, manager has access, and status is MANAGER_REVIEW

#### POST /api/manager/onboarding/{session_id}/i9-section2
- **Purpose**: Complete I-9 Section 2 employment eligibility verification
- **Access**: Manager role required
- **Payload**: Form data with document details and digital signature
- **Validation**: Ensures all required I-9 Section 2 fields are present
- **Features**: Supports both List A or List B+C document combinations

#### POST /api/manager/onboarding/{session_id}/approve
- **Purpose**: Manager approves onboarding and sends to HR
- **Access**: Manager role required
- **Payload**: Digital signature and optional approval notes
- **Actions**: 
  - Transitions to HR_APPROVAL phase
  - Sends email notification to HR users
  - Creates audit trail

#### POST /api/manager/onboarding/{session_id}/request-changes
- **Purpose**: Request changes from employee
- **Access**: Manager role required
- **Payload**: List of requested changes with forms and reasons
- **Actions**:
  - Reverts to EMPLOYEE phase
  - Sends email to employee with change requests
  - Creates audit trail

### 2. HR Approval APIs

#### GET /api/hr/onboarding/pending
- **Purpose**: Get all onboarding sessions pending HR approval
- **Access**: HR role required
- **Returns**: Enriched session data with employee, property, and manager details
- **Features**: Includes days since submission for prioritization

#### POST /api/hr/onboarding/{session_id}/approve
- **Purpose**: Final HR approval for onboarding
- **Access**: HR role required
- **Payload**: Digital signature and optional approval notes
- **Actions**:
  - Marks onboarding as APPROVED
  - Sends congratulations email to employee
  - Creates compliance check audit entry

#### POST /api/hr/onboarding/{session_id}/reject
- **Purpose**: HR rejection of onboarding
- **Access**: HR role required
- **Payload**: Rejection reason
- **Actions**:
  - Marks onboarding as REJECTED
  - Sends notification emails to employee and manager
  - Creates audit trail

#### POST /api/hr/onboarding/{session_id}/request-changes
- **Purpose**: HR requests specific form updates
- **Access**: HR role required
- **Payload**: Requested changes and target (employee or manager)
- **Features**: Can send requests back to either employee or manager
- **Actions**:
  - Updates phase based on request_from parameter
  - Sends appropriate email notifications
  - Creates audit trail

### 3. Email Notification Helper

#### POST /api/internal/send-phase-completion-email
- **Purpose**: Internal endpoint for sending phase completion notifications
- **Payload**: Session ID and completed phase
- **Actions**: Sends appropriate email based on phase completed

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Access Control
- All endpoints verify user roles using `Depends(require_manager_role)` or `Depends(require_hr_role)`
- Manager endpoints verify the manager is assigned to the specific session
- Proper 403 Forbidden responses for unauthorized access

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling
- 400 Bad Request for validation errors
- 401 Unauthorized for authentication failures
- 403 Forbidden for authorization failures
- 404 Not Found for missing resources
- 500 Internal Server Error with detailed logging

### 3. Audit Trail
- Every significant action creates an audit entry
- Includes user information, timestamps, and action details
- Tracks all state changes and approval decisions

### 4. Email Notifications
- Employee completion → Manager notification
- Manager approval → HR notification
- HR approval → Employee congratulations
- Change requests → Targeted notifications
- Rejections → Multi-party notifications

### 5. Workflow State Management
- Proper phase transitions (EMPLOYEE → MANAGER → HR)
- Status tracking throughout the process
- Support for reverting to previous phases for changes

## Model Updates

### OnboardingSession Model
Added the following fields to support the workflow:
- `requested_changes`: Track change requests from managers/HR
- `approved_by`: Track who gave final approval
- `rejected_by`: Track who rejected the application
- `rejected_at`: Timestamp for rejection

### Supabase Service Enhancements
Added mock implementations for:
- `get_onboarding_form_data()`: Retrieve all form data
- `get_onboarding_documents()`: Retrieve uploaded documents
- `get_onboarding_form_data_by_step()`: Get specific step data
- `get_users_by_role()`: Get users by role for notifications
- `store_onboarding_form_data()`: Store form submissions
- `store_onboarding_signature()`: Store digital signatures
- `create_audit_entry()`: Create audit trail entries

## Testing

A comprehensive test script has been created at `/test_three_phase_workflow_apis.py` that tests:
- All manager review endpoints
- All HR approval endpoints
- Email notification helper
- Various workflow scenarios

## Usage Examples

### Manager Completing I-9 Section 2
```python
POST /api/manager/onboarding/{session_id}/i9-section2
{
    "form_data": {
        "document_title_list_a": "US Passport",
        "issuing_authority_list_a": "U.S. Department of State",
        "document_number_list_a": "123456789",
        "expiration_date_list_a": "2030-01-01"
    },
    "signature_data": {
        "signature": "base64_encoded_signature",
        "signed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "ip_address": "192.168.1.1"
    }
}
```

### HR Requesting Changes from Employee
```python
POST /api/hr/onboarding/{session_id}/request-changes
{
    "requested_changes": [
        {"form": "w4_form", "reason": "Missing spouse information"},
        {"form": "direct_deposit", "reason": "Invalid routing number"}
    ],
    "request_from": "employee"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Database Integration**: The mock methods in supabase_service_enhanced.py should be connected to actual Supabase tables
2. **Frontend Integration**: Update the frontend to use these new endpoints
3. **Testing**: Run the test script with actual session data
4. **Email Templates**: Enhance email templates for better formatting
5. **Compliance Validation**: Add more comprehensive I-9 and W-4 validation rules

## Files Modified

1. `/hotel-onboarding-backend/app/main_enhanced.py` - Added all new API endpoints
2. `/hotel-onboarding-backend/app/models_enhanced.py` - Added missing fields to OnboardingSession
3. `/hotel-onboarding-backend/app/supabase_service_enhanced.py` - Added mock methods for data operations
4. `/hotel-onboarding-backend/app/services/onboarding_orchestrator.py` - Updated audit entry creation

The implementation follows FastAPI best practices with proper async/await patterns, comprehensive error handling, and clear separation of concerns between API endpoints and business logic.
