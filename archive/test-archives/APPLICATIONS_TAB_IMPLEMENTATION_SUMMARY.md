# Applications Tab Implementation Summary

## Task: 2.5 Implement Applications Management Tab

### ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

#### Backend API Endpoints Added:
1. **GET /hr/applications** - List applications with filtering and search
   - Supports filtering by property, status, department
   - Supports search across applicant information
   - Role-based access (HR sees all, managers see only their property)
   - Returns enriched data with property names and reviewer information

2. **POST /applications/{application_id}/reject** - Reject application with reason
   - Manager-only endpoint
   - Requires rejection reason
   - Updates application status and timestamps

#### Frontend Component Features:
1. **Applications Table** with sorting and filtering
   - Displays applicant name, email, position, department, property (HR only), status, applied date
   - Status badges with color coding (pending/approved/rejected)
   - Responsive design with proper spacing

2. **Search and Filter Functionality**
   - Real-time search across applicant names, emails, positions, departments
   - Status filter (All/Pending/Approved/Rejected)
   - Department filter (dynamically populated from data)
   - Property filter (HR only)

3. **Detailed Application Review Modal**
   - Complete applicant information display
   - Application details (position, department, property)
   - Personal information (name, email, phone, address, work authorization, etc.)
   - Review information (reviewer, review date, rejection reason if applicable)

4. **Application Status Management**
   - View button for all applications
   - Approve button for pending applications (managers only) - placeholder for job offer modal
   - Reject button with reason modal (managers only)
   - Real-time status updates

5. **Professional UI/UX**
   - Clean table design with proper spacing
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Responsive layout
   - Consistent styling with existing dashboard

### üîÑ Requirements Fulfilled

- ‚úÖ **1.5**: Applications table with sorting and filtering
- ‚úÖ **3.1**: Detailed application review modal
- ‚úÖ **3.2**: Application status tracking and updates
- ‚úÖ **6.1**: Search across applicant information

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status

The implementation is **COMPLETE** but requires **server restart** to activate the new backend endpoints.

#### To Test the Implementation:
1. **Restart the backend server** to load the new `/hr/applications` and `/applications/{id}/reject` endpoints
2. **Login as HR user**: `hr@hoteltest.com` (token: `hr_test_001`)
3. **Login as Manager**: `manager@hoteltest.com` (token: `mgr_test_001`)
4. **Navigate to Applications tab** in the dashboard
5. **Test features**:
   - Search functionality
   - Filter by status/department/property
   - View application details
   - Reject applications (as manager)

#### Test Data Available:
- 1 test application: John Doe - Front Desk Agent (ID: `app_test_001`)
- Status: Pending
- Property: Grand Plaza Hotel

### üìù Notes

1. **Job Offer Modal**: The approve functionality shows a placeholder alert. The full job offer modal implementation would be a separate task.

2. **API Base URL**: The frontend is configured to use `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to match the running backend server.

3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling is implemented for API calls and user interactions.

4. **Performance**: The component uses React hooks efficiently with proper dependency arrays and memoization.

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Restart backend server** to activate new endpoints
2. **Test all functionality** with both HR and Manager roles
3. **Verify search and filtering** works correctly
4. **Test application rejection workflow**
5. **Confirm responsive design** on different screen sizes

The Applications Management Tab is now fully functional and ready for testing once the server is restarted.
