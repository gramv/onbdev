## Automated Test Prerequisites

Before manual testing, ensure these automated tests pass:

```bash
# Backend health check
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz

# Backend integration tests
python3 test_backend_integration_simple.py

# Frontend unit tests (sample)
cd hotel-onboarding-frontend && npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

All automated tests should pass before beginning manual UAT.
