# Final Testing Instructions for Tasks 2.1-2.5

## 🎯 Current Status

**Tasks 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 are FULLY FUNCTIONAL** ✅
**Tasks 2.4 and 2.5 are COMPLETE but need server restart** ⚠️

## 🚀 To Complete Testing

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server
The server is currently running old code. New endpoints need to be loaded:

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running in terminal)
# Then restart:
cd hotel-onboarding-backend
python -m app.main_enhanced
```

### Step 2: Test All Functionality

- **HR User**: `hr@hoteltest.com` / `admin123`
- **Manager User**: `manager@hoteltest.com` / `admin123`

#### Test Sequence:

1. **Login as HR** → Navigate to HR Dashboard
2. **Test Task 2.1** - Dashboard Layout:
   - ✅ Verify 5 tabs display correctly
   - ✅ Check statistics cards show real data

     - Alice Smith (Front Desk Agent)
     - Bob Johnson (Housekeeper)
     - Carol Davis (Server)
     - David Wilson (Maintenance Tech)
     - Emma Brown (Night Auditor)
   - 🔄 Test search and filtering
   - 🔄 View employee details modal

6. **Test Task 2.5** - Applications Tab (after restart):

   - 🔄 Test search functionality
   - 🔄 Filter by status/department
   - 🔄 View application details modal
   - 🔄 Login as Manager and test approve/reject

## 📊 Expected Test Results

### After Server Restart, These Endpoints Should Work:

```bash
# Employee endpoints
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer hr_test_001" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer hr_test_001" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/filters/options"

# Application endpoints  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer hr_test_001" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/hr/applications"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mgr_test_001" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/hr/applications"
```

### Expected Data:
- **5 employees** with different departments and statuses
- **1 pending application** from John Doe
