# Job Application System Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Updated the hotel job application system backend to match the comprehensive Employment Application Form PDF requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Department and Position Configuration

**In `/hotel-onboarding-backend/app/main_enhanced.py`**:

Updated `departments_and_positions` configuration:
- **Front Desk**: 
  - Kept: "Front Desk Agent", "Night Auditor"
  - Added: "Manager on Duty"
  - Removed: "Guest Services Representative", "Concierge"
  
- **Housekeeping**: 
  - Kept: "Housekeeper", "Housekeeping Supervisor", "Laundry Attendant"
  - Added: "Groundskeeper"
  - Removed: "Public Area Attendant"
  
- **Food & Beverage**: 
  - Kept only: "Breakfast Attendant"
  - Removed: "Server", "Bartender", "Host/Hostess", "Kitchen Staff", "Banquet Server"
  
- **Maintenance**: 
  - Kept: "Maintenance Technician", "Groundskeeper"
  - Removed: "Engineering Assistant"

### 2. Enhanced JobApplicationData Model

**In `/hotel-onboarding-backend/app/models.py`**:

Created comprehensive data models matching the PDF form:

#### New Supporting Models:
- `EducationEntry`: For education history entries
- `EmploymentHistoryEntry`: For employment history (last 3 employers)
- `PersonalReference`: For personal reference information
- `ConvictionRecord`: For conviction record details
- `MilitaryService`: For military service information
- `VoluntarySelfIdentification`: For EEOC voluntary self-identification

#### Enhanced JobApplicationData Fields:
- **Personal Information**:
  - Added: `middle_initial`, `apartment_unit`, `phone_type`, `secondary_phone`, `secondary_phone_type`
  
- **Position Information**:
  - Added: `salary_desired`
  
- **Work Authorization & Legal**:
  - Added: `age_verification`, `conviction_record`
  
- **Availability**:
  - Enhanced `employment_type` to include: "on_call", "seasonal_temporary"
  - Added: `seasonal_start_date`, `seasonal_end_date`
  
- **Previous Employment**:
  - Added: `previous_hotel_employment`, `previous_hotel_details`
  
- **Referral Source**:
  - Added: `how_heard`, `how_heard_detailed`
  
- **Comprehensive Sections**:
  - Added: `personal_reference`, `military_service`, `education_history`, `employment_history`, `skills_languages_certifications`, `voluntary_self_identification`

### 3. Updated Submit Application Endpoint

Enhanced the `/apply/{property_id}` endpoint to:
- Accept the comprehensive application data structure
- Convert all nested models to dictionaries for storage
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing fields
- Use `model_dump()` instead of deprecated `dict()` method

## Test Results

Created comprehensive test script (`test_enhanced_job_application.py`) that validates:
1. Property information endpoint returns updated departments/positions
2. Comprehensive application submission with all new fields
3. Minimal application submission with only required fields

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ GET `/properties/{property_id}/info` - Returns updated departments/positions
- ✅ POST `/apply/{property_id}` - Accepts comprehensive application data
- ✅ POST `/apply/{property_id}` - Accepts minimal required data

## API Endpoints

### Get Property Application Info
```
GET /properties/{property_id}/info
```
Returns available departments and positions for job applications.

### Submit Job Application
```
POST /apply/{property_id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "first_name": "string",
  "middle_initial": "string",
  "last_name": "string",
  "email": "email@example.com",
  "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
  "phone_type": "cell|home",
  // ... all other comprehensive fields
}
```

## Next Steps

The backend is now ready to accept comprehensive job applications matching the Employment Application Form PDF. The frontend job application form will need to be updated to:
1. Include all new fields from the PDF
2. Implement proper validation for each field
3. Handle the nested data structures (education history, employment history, etc.)
4. Update position dropdown to reflect new department/position structure
