# Testing the Beautiful Welcome Page

Since the server is already running, here's how to test the welcome page:

## Method 1: Manual Testing (Recommended)

### Step 1: Set up test data using existing scripts
```bash
cd hotel-onboarding-backend
python3 setup_test_accounts.py
```

### Step 2: Create a property and approve an application
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/secret to create HR account
2. Login as HR and create a property
3. Assign a manager to the property
4. Submit a job application via the property's application URL
5. Login as manager and approve the application

### Step 3: Visit the welcome page
After approval, you'll get an employee ID. Visit:
```
http://localhost:3000/onboarding-welcome/{employee_id}
```

## Method 2: Quick API Test (If you have existing data)

### Check existing employees:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/employees
```

### Test welcome data for an existing employee:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/employees/{employee_id}/welcome-data
```

### Visit the welcome page:
```
http://localhost:3000/onboarding-welcome/{employee_id}
```

## Method 3: Use Existing Test Data

If you have existing test data from previous testing:

1. **Check the backend logs** to see employee IDs that were created
2. **Try these example URLs**:
   - http://localhost:3000/onboarding-welcome/test-employee-1
   - http://localhost:3000/onboarding-welcome/any-existing-employee-id

## What You Should See

When the welcome page loads correctly, you'll see:

‚úÖ **Property Branding**: Hotel name and address in the header
‚úÖ **Personal Greeting**: "Welcome, [Employee Name]!"
‚úÖ **Property Welcome**: "You're now part of the [Hotel Name] family"
‚úÖ **Job Details Card**: Position, department, start date, pay rate, supervisor
‚úÖ **Onboarding Steps**: 6 steps with icons and time estimates
‚úÖ **Language Toggle**: English/Spanish switcher in header
‚úÖ **Important Information**: Document requirements and support info
‚úÖ **Begin Onboarding Button**: Large green button to start process

## Expected Features:

### üè® Property Information Display
- Dynamic property name (e.g., "Grand Vista Hotel")
- Property address
- Professional blue gradient header

### üëã Personalized Welcome
- Employee first name from application
- Congratulatory messaging
- Property-specific welcome message

### üíº Job Details
- Position title
- Department
- Start date and time
- Pay rate and frequency
- Supervisor name
- Work location

### üåê Multi-Language Support
- Language selector in header
- Complete Spanish translations
- Dynamic content switching

## Troubleshooting

### If you see a blank page:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the employee ID exists in the backend
3. Check that the backend server is running on port 8000

### If you see "Unable to load information":
1. The employee ID doesn't exist
2. The backend API endpoint is not responding
3. The employee doesn't have complete data (property_id, etc.)

### If the property name doesn't show:
1. Check that the employee has a valid property_id
2. Verify the property exists in the database
3. Check the backend logs for API errors

## Quick Backend Check

To verify your backend has the right data:

```bash
# Check if employees exist
curl http://localhost:8000/api/employees

# Check specific employee welcome data
curl http://localhost:8000/api/employees/EMPLOYEE_ID/welcome-data

# Should return:
{
  "employee": {...},
  "property": {"name": "Hotel Name", "address": "..."},
  "applicant_data": {"first_name": "...", "last_name": "..."}
}
```
