# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: HR Manager System Fix and Manager Review Dashboard
> Created: 2025-08-19
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix critical HR property and manager management functionality that is currently failing (only 30.4% PRD compliance), and complete the Manager Review Dashboard for application review and I-9 Section 2 completion. This spec is designed for efficient parallel execution using specialized Claude agents.

## User Stories

### HR Admin Story

As an HR Administrator, I want to create and manage properties and assign managers to them, so that I can properly organize our multi-property hotel operations.

Currently, I cannot create properties or manager accounts through the system, which blocks the entire workflow. The API endpoints exist but return errors when attempting these critical operations.

### Manager Story  

As a Property Manager, I want to review job applications for my property and complete the I-9 Section 2 verification, so that I can properly onboard new employees within federal compliance deadlines.

Currently, I can log in but cannot properly review applications or complete the required I-9 employer verification section, leaving the onboarding process incomplete.

## Spec Scope

1. **Fix Property CRUD Operations** - Repair the broken property creation, update, and management endpoints that HR needs
2. **Fix Manager Account Creation** - Enable HR to create manager accounts with proper password hashing and role assignment
3. **Fix Manager-Property Assignment** - Ensure managers are properly linked to properties with correct database relationships
4. **Complete Manager Review Interface** - Build the UI for managers to review and approve/reject applications
5. **Implement I-9 Section 2 Flow** - Create the employer verification interface for federal I-9 compliance

## Out of Scope

- Module distribution system (separate future spec)
- Compliance deadline tracking (separate future spec)
- Manager performance metrics
- Email notifications
- Audit logging enhancements

## Expected Deliverable

1. HR can successfully create, update, and delete properties through the dashboard
2. HR can create manager accounts that can immediately log in with assigned credentials
3. Managers can review all applications for their assigned property only
4. Managers can complete I-9 Section 2 verification with digital signature
5. All PRD requirements FR-PROP-001, FR-PROP-003, FR-MGR-001, FR-MGR-002 passing tests
