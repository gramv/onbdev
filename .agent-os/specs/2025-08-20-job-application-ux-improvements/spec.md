## Overview

Implement comprehensive UX improvements for the hotel job application form, focusing on mobile responsiveness, visual design modernization, enhanced error handling, and improved user experience through auto-save functionality and better form feedback mechanisms.

## User Stories

### Mobile User Experience

As a job applicant using a mobile device, I want to complete the application form without horizontal scrolling or UI elements being too small to interact with, so that I can apply for jobs easily from my phone.

The user opens the job application on their phone. The form automatically adapts to their screen size with properly sized touch targets (minimum 44x44px), vertically stacked form fields, and a sticky navigation bar for easy step switching. The form auto-saves their progress every 30 seconds, allowing them to continue later if interrupted.

### Form Validation and Error Recovery

As a job applicant, I want clear, immediate feedback when I make errors in the form, so that I can correct them without losing my work or becoming frustrated.

When filling out the form, users receive real-time validation feedback on field blur. Invalid fields show a red border with a specific error message below the field. Valid fields display a green checkmark. If they try to proceed with errors, the form auto-scrolls to the first error field and focuses it, with a subtle shake animation to draw attention.

### Visual Clarity and Progress Tracking

As a job applicant, I want to clearly see my progress through the application and understand what information is required in each section, so that I can complete the application efficiently.

The application displays a prominent progress bar showing percentage complete, with step indicators that show completed (green checkmark), current (blue), and upcoming (gray) steps. Each section has an appropriate icon (User for personal info, Briefcase for employment, etc.) and clear visual hierarchy with card-based layouts and proper spacing.

## Spec Scope

1. **Mobile-First Responsive Design** - Implement responsive breakpoints at 640px, 768px, and 1024px with mobile-optimized layouts
2. **Enhanced Visual Design** - Modern card-based UI with section icons, improved spacing, and visual feedback states
3. **Real-Time Form Validation** - Implement field-level validation on blur with inline error messages and success indicators
4. **Auto-Save and Progress Persistence** - Save form data to localStorage every 30 seconds with application recovery capability
5. **Improved Error Handling** - Network error recovery, auto-scroll to errors, and user-friendly error messages

## Out of Scope

- Backend API changes (validation logic remains server-side)
- New form fields or sections
- Multi-language improvements beyond current implementation
- PDF generation or document upload features
- Integration with third-party services

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully responsive job application form that works seamlessly on mobile devices (320px+), tablets, and desktops
2. User can see real-time validation feedback with specific error messages and successfully complete the form with clear guidance
3. Form progress auto-saves every 30 seconds and can be recovered using an application ID if the user returns later
