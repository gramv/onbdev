# Product Mission

## Pitch

Hotel Onboarding System is a Manager-driven digital onboarding platform that enables hotel managers to directly approve job applications and guide new employees through complete onboarding, generating exact replicas of the 28-page hire packet with full federal compliance.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Hotel Properties**: Single hotels needing simple, effective onboarding without HR complexity
- **Hotel Managers**: Department managers who directly handle hiring and onboarding for their teams

### User Personas

**Hotel Manager** (35-50 years old)
- **Role:** Department Manager with hiring authority
- **Context:** Directly manages hiring for housekeeping, front desk, or food service
- **Pain Points:** 28-page paper packet takes 2-3 hours per employee, documents get lost, compliance tracking
- **Goals:** Approve applications instantly, track onboarding progress, access all documents digitally

**Job Applicant / New Employee** (18-65 years old)
- **Role:** Prospective or newly hired hotel staff
- **Context:** Applying for hospitality positions through property-specific links
- **Pain Points:** Complex paper forms, unclear instructions, multiple document submissions
- **Goals:** Complete everything online via single link, clear guidance, start work quickly

## The Problem

### Exact Packet Replication Challenge

Hotels need digital versions that exactly match their 28-page paper packet format, not generic forms that look different and confuse staff.

**Our Solution:** Pixel-perfect replication of existing packet pages with identical formatting and content.

### Manager-Centric Workflow

Managers need direct control over hiring without waiting for HR approvals or complex multi-level processes.

**Our Solution:** Manager approves → Employee gets link → Documents generate automatically. No HR involvement needed.

### Document Preview and Accessibility

Managers can't preview documents before employees sign them, and signed documents aren't easily accessible.

**Our Solution:** Every document has preview capability before signing, and managers can access all completed documents instantly.

## Differentiators

### Exact Hire Packet Matching

Unlike generic HR systems with standard forms, we replicate your exact 28-page packet format, ensuring staff recognition and compliance with your specific requirements.

### Manager-Direct Control

Unlike systems requiring HR intermediaries, managers have complete control: approve applications, track progress, and access documents without involving additional departments.

### 100% Document Preview

Unlike systems where you hope documents generate correctly, every single form has preview capability before signing, ensuring accuracy and reducing errors.
