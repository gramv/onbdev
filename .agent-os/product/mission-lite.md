# Product Mission (Lite)

Hotel Onboarding MVP is a streamlined digital onboarding system that helps hotel managers efficiently process job applications and onboard new employees by providing a simplified workflow with complete document generation and federal compliance built-in.

The system serves small to mid-size hotels needing to digitize their 28-page paper onboarding packet, reducing onboarding time from 2-3 hours to 30 minutes. Unlike enterprise HR systems, we focus on single-property simplicity with complete document generation including company policies, direct deposit, and insurance forms that competitors often miss.
