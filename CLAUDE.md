# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive hotel employee onboarding system built with a FastAPI backend and React/TypeScript frontend. The system handles the complete employee lifecycle from job application to onboarding completion, including document management, digital signatures, and compliance requirements.

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**: This system is being rebuilt using a **brick-by-brick methodology** where each page/component is built individually, tested thoroughly, then connected to the next page. This ensures a stable, working system at each step rather than attempting to build everything at once.

**MODULAR FORM ARCHITECTURE**: The system is designed with complete modularity where individual forms (W-4, I-9, health insurance, etc.) can be sent independently to employees for updates at any time. When an employee's situation changes (marriage, dependents, address), HR can send just the specific form needed for update without requiring a complete onboarding process.

## Three-Phase Onboarding Workflow

1. **Employee Phase**: Complete required forms and documentation
2. **Manager Phase**: Review employee submissions and complete I-9 Section 2
3. **HR Phase**: Final approval and compliance verification

## Brick-by-Brick Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Cleanup (CURRENT FOCUS)
**Status**: âœ… IN PROGRESS - Fixing component prop structure

- **Validation**: Must validate tax calculations and withholding amounts
- **Digital Signature**: Must capture employee signature with legal compliance metadata
- **Updates**: Employees can update W-4 information at any time

### Federal Documentation Standards
- **Digital Signatures**: Must include timestamp, IP address, legal compliance metadata
- **Data Retention**: All federal forms must be retained per government requirements
- **Privacy Protection**: All personal information must be encrypted and secured
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail required for all compliance-related actions

## Component Architecture

### Step Component Pattern (CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION)
All onboarding step components follow this standardized pattern:

```typescript
interface StepProps {
  currentStep: any
  progress: any
  markStepComplete: (stepId: string, data?: any) => void
  saveProgress: (stepId: string, data?: any) => void
  language: 'en' | 'es'
  employee?: any
  property?: any
}

export default function StepName(props: StepProps) {
  // Component implementation using direct props
  // NO useOutletContext() calls
}
```

### Data Management
- **autoFillManager**: Centralized utility for managing form auto-fill across steps
- **Progress Tracking**: Each step saves progress independently with step ID
- **Validation**: Each component handles its own validation and completion status

## Testing Strategy

### Component-Level Testing
- **Individual Step Testing**: Each step component tested in isolation
- **Props Interface Testing**: Verify all components work with standardized props
- **Validation Testing**: Test form validation and completion logic

### Integration Testing  
- **Navigation Flow**: Test navigation between steps
- **Data Persistence**: Test data saving and loading across steps
- **Language Switching**: Test bilingual functionality

### End-to-End Testing
- **Complete Workflow**: Test entire onboarding process from start to finish
- **Manager Integration**: Test manager review and completion workflow
- **Federal Compliance**: Test all government compliance requirements

- **Applications**: JobApplication with validation and status tracking
- **Onboarding**: OnboardingSession with progress tracking and step management
- **Documents**: Document, DigitalSignature with OCR and approval workflows
- **Forms**: Specialized models for I-9, W-4, health insurance, personal info

## Authentication

- Token-based authentication using user IDs as tokens
- Role-based access control (HR, Manager, Employee)
- Special endpoints for HR user creation with secret keys
- Property-based access restrictions for managers

## Environment Setup

The system expects the following environment variables:
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: For OCR document processing
- `GROQ_MODEL`: Model to use (default: llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
- `GROQ_MAX_TOKENS`: Token limit for API calls
- `GROQ_TEMPERATURE`: Temperature for API responses
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`: Email configuration
- `EMAIL_FROM`: Sender email address for notifications

## Development Notes

- CORS is fully disabled for development (allow all origins)
- File uploads are stored in base64 format in the in-memory database
- The system includes test data creation scripts (`create_test_data.py`, `setup_test_accounts.py`)
- Enhanced components are the primary implementations with federal compliance and validation
- Onboarding workflow supports multi-language (EN/ES) and government compliance requirements
- **CRITICAL**: Always test each component individually before integrating into the full workflow
- **CRITICAL**: Follow the brick-by-brick approach - build one page, test it, then move to the next
- **CRITICAL**: Never attempt to build the entire onboarding experience at once

## API Endpoints Structure

### Public Endpoints (No Auth Required)
- `GET /api/properties/{property_id}/public-info` - Public property information
- `POST /api/job-application` - Submit job application
- `GET /api/qr/{qr_id}` - Redirect from QR code scan

### HR Endpoints (HR Role Required)
- `POST /api/hr/create` - Create HR user with secret key
- `GET /api/hr/dashboard` - HR dashboard data
- `POST /api/properties` - Create new property
- `GET /api/analytics/*` - Analytics endpoints

### Manager Endpoints (Manager Role Required)
- `GET /api/managers/dashboard` - Manager dashboard data
- `POST /api/managers/complete-i9-section2` - Complete I-9 Section 2
- `PUT /api/applications/{app_id}/status` - Update application status
- `GET /api/managers/talent-pool` - View talent pool

### Employee Endpoints (Employee Role Required)
- `GET /api/onboarding/session` - Get onboarding session
- `POST /api/onboarding/step/{step_id}` - Submit step data
- `POST /api/documents/upload` - Upload documents
- `GET /api/forms/pdf/*` - Generate PDF forms

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Navigation Hook Pattern
```typescript
// Use the simplified navigation hook
import { useSimpleNavigation } from '@/hooks/use-simple-navigation';

function Component() {
  const { navigateToStep, navigateBack } = useSimpleNavigation();
  // Use for step navigation
}
```

### Form Validation Pattern
```typescript
// All forms use Zod schemas with React Hook Form
const schema = z.object({
  field: z.string().min(1, "Required"),
  // Federal compliance validations
});
```

### API Request Pattern
```typescript
// Consistent error handling and auth headers
const response = await axios.post('/api/endpoint', data, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Port Conflicts
- Backend runs on port 8000
- Frontend runs on port 3000
- Kill existing processes: `lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9`

### Component Props Issues
- All step components use direct props, not useOutletContext
- Follow the StepProps interface pattern

### Navigation Issues
- Use the simplified navigation hook (use-simple-navigation.ts)
- Avoid complex routing libraries for step navigation

### Testing Failed Imports
- Ensure all test files import from correct paths
- Use `@/` alias for src directory imports

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data encrypted in transit
- Authentication tokens stored securely
- File uploads validated for type and size
- SQL injection prevented via Pydantic models
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- CSRF protection via token-based auth


## Testing Individual Components

### Running a Single Test
```bash
# Backend
cd hotel-onboarding-backend
poetry run pytest tests/test_specific_file.py::test_function_name -v

# Frontend
cd hotel-onboarding-frontend
npm test -- --testNamePattern="specific test name"
```

### Utility Scripts
- `start_backend.sh`: Starts backend server in background
- `stop_servers.sh`: Stops all running servers
- `restart_servers.sh`: Restarts both frontend and backend

## Key Backend Services

### OnboardingOrchestrator (`app/services/onboarding_orchestrator.py`)
Manages the complete onboarding workflow state machine, handling transitions between employee, manager, and HR phases.

### FormUpdateService (`app/services/form_update_service.py`)
Enables individual form updates outside the full onboarding flow, critical for the modular architecture.

### Email Service (`app/email_service.py`)
Handles all notification emails including onboarding invitations, approval notifications, and form update requests.

### PDF Forms (`app/pdf_forms.py`)
Generates official government-compliant PDFs for I-9, W-4, and other federal forms with exact field mapping.

## Common Gotchas

1. **Component Props**: All step components must use direct props, not `useOutletContext()`
2. **File Paths**: Always use absolute paths when working with file operations
3. **Testing**: The `/test-steps` route is crucial for testing components in isolation
4. **Enhanced vs Basic**: Use `main_enhanced.py` for full onboarding features, `main.py` for basic HR functionality
5. **Form IDs**: Each form component expects consistent IDs for progress tracking (e.g., 'welcome', 'personal-info', 'i9-section1')
