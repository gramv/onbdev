# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive hotel employee onboarding system built with a FastAPI backend and React/TypeScript frontend. The system handles the complete employee lifecycle from job application to onboarding completion, including document management, digital signatures, and compliance requirements.

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**: This system is being rebuilt using a **brick-by-brick methodology** where each page/component is built individually, tested thoroughly, then connected to the next page. This ensures a stable, working system at each step rather than attempting to build everything at once.

**MODULAR FORM ARCHITECTURE**: The system is designed with complete modularity where individual forms (W-4, I-9, health insurance, etc.) can be sent independently to employees for updates at any time. When an employee's situation changes (marriage, dependents, address), HR can send just the specific form needed for update without requiring a complete onboarding process.

## Brick-by-Brick Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Cleanup (CURRENT FOCUS)
**Status**: âœ… IN PROGRESS - Fixing component prop structure

**Completed Tasks:**
- âœ… Fixed WelcomeStep component to use direct props instead of useOutletContext
- âœ… Fixed PersonalInfoStep component prop structure
- âœ… Fixed I9Section1Step component prop structure
- âœ… Created TestStepComponents for isolated testing
- âœ… Added autoFillManager utility for consistent data management

**Current Task:**
- ðŸ”„ Testing basic component rendering and navigation
- ðŸ”„ Ensuring all step components work with direct props pattern

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete remaining step component fixes (JobDetailsStep, etc.)
2. Create simple navigation wrapper that works
3. Test basic data flow between components
4. Verify each component renders without errors

## Government Compliance Requirements

### I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification
- **Section 1**: Must be completed by employee on or before first day of work
- **Section 2**: Must be completed by employer within 3 business days of start date
- **Supplements A/B**: Only used in specific circumstances, most fields must remain blank
- **Document Requirements**: Must verify both identity AND work authorization
- **Retention**: Must be retained for 3 years after hire date or 1 year after termination

### W-4 Employee's Withholding Certificate
- **IRS Compliance**: Must use current year IRS form template
- **Validation**: Must validate tax calculations and withholding amounts
- **Digital Signature**: Must capture employee signature with legal compliance metadata
- **Updates**: Employees can update W-4 information at any time

### Federal Documentation Standards
- **Digital Signatures**: Must include timestamp, IP address, legal compliance metadata
- **Data Retention**: All federal forms must be retained per government requirements
- **Privacy Protection**: All personal information must be encrypted and secured
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail required for all compliance-related actions

## Component Architecture

### Step Component Pattern (CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION)
All onboarding step components follow this standardized pattern:

```typescript
interface StepProps {
  currentStep: any
  progress: any
  markStepComplete: (stepId: string, data?: any) => void
  saveProgress: (stepId: string, data?: any) => void
  language: 'en' | 'es'
  employee?: any
  property?: any
}

export default function StepName(props: StepProps) {
  // Component implementation using direct props
  // NO useOutletContext() calls
}
```

### Data Management
- **autoFillManager**: Centralized utility for managing form auto-fill across steps
- **Progress Tracking**: Each step saves progress independently with step ID
- **Validation**: Each component handles its own validation and completion status

## Testing Strategy

### Component-Level Testing
- **Individual Step Testing**: Each step component tested in isolation
- **Props Interface Testing**: Verify all components work with standardized props
- **Validation Testing**: Test form validation and completion logic

### Integration Testing  
- **Navigation Flow**: Test navigation between steps
- **Data Persistence**: Test data saving and loading across steps
- **Language Switching**: Test bilingual functionality

### End-to-End Testing
- **Complete Workflow**: Test entire onboarding process from start to finish
- **Manager Integration**: Test manager review and completion workflow
- **Federal Compliance**: Test all government compliance requirements

- **Dependencies**: Managed via Poetry (`pyproject.toml`)

### Frontend (hotel-onboarding-frontend/)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API (AuthContext, LanguageContext)
- **Key Pages**:
  - `HomePage.tsx`: Landing page
  - `LoginPage.tsx`: Authentication
  - `HRDashboard.tsx`: HR management interface
  - `ManagerDashboard.tsx`: Manager review interface
  - `JobApplicationForm.tsx`: Public job application
  - `EnhancedOnboardingPortal.tsx`: Primary employee onboarding workflow with government compliance
- **Components**: Modular form components in `components/` including:
  - `I9Section1Form.tsx`: Federal-compliant I-9 Section 1 with validation
  - `W4Form.tsx`: IRS-compliant W-4 Employee's Withholding Certificate
  - `HealthInsuranceForm.tsx`: Health insurance enrollment
  - `DirectDepositForm.tsx`: Banking information setup
  - `EmergencyContactsForm.tsx`: Emergency contact information
  - Digital signature capture and verification components

## Data Models

The system uses comprehensive Pydantic models defined in `models.py`:
- **User Management**: User, Property models with role-based access
- **Applications**: JobApplication with validation and status tracking
- **Onboarding**: OnboardingSession with progress tracking and step management
- **Documents**: Document, DigitalSignature with OCR and approval workflows
- **Forms**: Specialized models for I-9, W-4, health insurance, personal info

## Authentication

- Token-based authentication using user IDs as tokens
- Role-based access control (HR, Manager, Employee)
- Special endpoints for HR user creation with secret keys
- Property-based access restrictions for managers

## Environment Setup

The system expects the following environment variables:
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: For OCR document processing
- `GROQ_MODEL`: Model to use (default: llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
- `GROQ_MAX_TOKENS`: Token limit for API calls
- `GROQ_TEMPERATURE`: Temperature for API responses

## Development Notes

- CORS is fully disabled for development (allow all origins)
- File uploads are stored in base64 format in the in-memory database
- The system includes test data creation scripts (`create_test_data.py`, `setup_test_accounts.py`)
- Enhanced components are the primary implementations with federal compliance and validation
- Onboarding workflow supports multi-language (EN/ES) and government compliance requirements
- **CRITICAL**: Always test each component individually before integrating into the full workflow
- **CRITICAL**: Follow the brick-by-brick approach - build one page, test it, then move to the next
- **CRITICAL**: Never attempt to build the entire onboarding experience at once
