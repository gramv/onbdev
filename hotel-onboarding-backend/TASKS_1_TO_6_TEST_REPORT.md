## Issues to Address

### High Priority
None - All critical functionality is working.

### Medium Priority
1. **Create Supabase tables**: `notifications` and `user_preferences` tables need to be created
2. **Fix UUID format**: Property IDs in tests should use proper UUID format

### Low Priority
1. **Implement missing methods**: Add missing PropertyAccessController methods
2. **Add Supabase methods**: Implement `get_applications` and `get_employees` methods

---

## Recommendations

1. **Database Setup**:
   ```sql
   -- Run these migrations in Supabase
   CREATE TABLE notifications (...);
   CREATE TABLE user_preferences (...);
   ```

2. **Method Implementation**:
   - Add the missing PropertyAccessController methods
   - Implement the missing Supabase service methods

3. **Testing**:
   - Continue running comprehensive tests after each major change
   - Add automated CI/CD testing pipeline
