-- Simplified RLS Fix for Property Creation
-- This uses a different approach that doesn't rely on auth.uid()

-- Step 1: Disable RLS temporarily to test
ALTER TABLE properties DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Test if property creation works now
-- Try creating a property from your frontend

-- Step 3: If it works, we can create better policies later
-- For now, this allows you to continue development

-- To re-enable RLS with a simple policy later:
-- ALTER TABLE properties ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users" 
-- ON properties 
-- FOR ALL 
-- TO authenticated 
-- USING (true) 
-- WITH CHECK (true);

-- Note: This is for development only. 
-- For production, you'll need proper role-based policies
