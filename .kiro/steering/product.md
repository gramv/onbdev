# HR Manager Dashboard System

A comprehensive administrative platform for hotel properties that manages job applications, candidates, and property operations through role-based dashboards.

## Core Features

- **HR Administrative Dashboard**: Full system oversight across all properties with comprehensive management tools
- **Manager Property Dashboard**: Property-specific interface for managing applications and candidates
- **Application Management**: Review, approve, and reject job applications with detailed candidate information
- **Property Management**: Create and manage hotel properties with QR code generation for applications
- **Manager Assignment**: Assign managers to properties and control access permissions
- **Analytics & Reporting**: System metrics, property performance, and application statistics
- **Professional UI/UX**: Clean, consistent interface with responsive design

## User Roles

- **HR Administrator**: Full system access - manage all properties, managers, applications, and candidates across the organization
- **Property Manager**: Property-specific access - manage applications and candidates for their assigned property only

## Key Workflows

1. **Property Setup**: HR creates properties → assigns managers → generates QR codes for applications
2. **Application Review**: Candidates apply → managers review applications → approve/reject decisions
3. **Candidate Management**: Track application status → manage candidate information → generate hiring reports
4. **Administrative Oversight**: HR monitors all properties → reviews system analytics → manages user accounts

## Current Focus

The system currently focuses on the administrative and management aspects of the hiring process. Candidates/prospects apply through external forms, and the system manages the review and approval workflow. No employee accounts or onboarding processes are implemented at this stage.
