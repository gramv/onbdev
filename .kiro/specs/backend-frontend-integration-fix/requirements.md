# Backend-Frontend Integration Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical integration issues between the hotel onboarding system's backend API and frontend application. Based on comprehensive analysis, multiple gaps and inconsistencies have been identified that prevent seamless user experience for HR administrators, property managers, and job applicants.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication System Standardization

**User Story:** As a system user (HR/Manager), I want reliable authentication that works consistently across all interfaces, so that I can access the system without login failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return consistent error format with appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN a token expires THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and refresh token capability
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL properly invalidate the session
5. IF a user accesses protected endpoints without valid token THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized with consistent error format

### Requirement 2: API Endpoint Consistency

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent API endpoint patterns and responses, so that the application can reliably communicate with the backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend makes API calls THEN all endpoints SHALL follow consistent URL parameter patterns (e.g., {id} format)
2. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL include all fields expected by the frontend components
3. WHEN errors occur THEN all endpoints SHALL return consistent error response format with 'detail' field
4. WHEN pagination is needed THEN endpoints SHALL provide consistent pagination metadata
5. IF an endpoint doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return 404 with proper error format

### Requirement 3: HR Dashboard Data Integration

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want complete and accurate dashboard data, so that I can effectively manage properties, managers, and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HR accesses dashboard stats THEN the system SHALL return totalProperties, totalManagers, totalEmployees, and pendingApplications
2. WHEN HR views properties THEN each property SHALL include id, name, address, city, state, qr_code_url, and manager_ids
3. WHEN HR views applications THEN each application SHALL include id, property_id, department, position, applicant_data, status, and applied_at
4. WHEN HR manages managers THEN the system SHALL provide complete manager profiles with property assignments
5. IF data is missing or inconsistent THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide fallback values

### Requirement 4: Manager Dashboard Functionality

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want access to my property-specific data and application management tools, so that I can efficiently review and process job applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN manager logs in THEN the system SHALL provide access to assigned property information
2. WHEN manager views applications THEN the system SHALL show only applications for their assigned property
3. WHEN manager approves/rejects applications THEN the system SHALL process the action and send appropriate notifications
4. WHEN manager accesses dashboard stats THEN the system SHALL return property-specific metrics
5. IF manager has no property assignment THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messaging

### Requirement 5: Application Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a job applicant, I want a smooth application submission and tracking process, so that I can easily apply for positions and receive timely updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applicant accesses property info THEN the system SHALL return property details, available positions, and application URL
2. WHEN applicant submits application THEN the system SHALL validate data and provide confirmation
3. WHEN application status changes THEN the system SHALL send email notifications to the applicant
4. WHEN manager approves application THEN the system SHALL create employee record and initiate onboarding
5. IF application is rejected THEN the system SHALL move candidate to talent pool with notification

### Requirement 6: Email Notification System

**User Story:** As a system stakeholder, I want reliable email notifications for all workflow events, so that users stay informed of application status changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application is approved THEN the system SHALL send approval email with job details and onboarding link
2. WHEN application is rejected THEN the system SHALL send professional rejection email
3. WHEN candidate is moved to talent pool THEN the system SHALL send talent pool notification
4. WHEN onboarding is initiated THEN the system SHALL send welcome email with secure onboarding link
5. IF email service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log notifications and provide fallback mechanism

### Requirement 7: Data Consistency and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent data across all endpoints and proper validation, so that the system maintains data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is retrieved from multiple endpoints THEN it SHALL be consistent across all sources
2. WHEN data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and formats
3. WHEN relationships exist (e.g., manager-property) THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity
4. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL ensure atomic transactions
5. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error messages with field-specific feedback

### Requirement 8: Error Handling Standardization

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent error handling across all API endpoints, so that I can provide meaningful error messages to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 422 with detailed field errors
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 with clear error message
3. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return 403 with access denied message
4. WHEN resources are not found THEN the system SHALL return 404 with resource identification
5. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 500 with generic error message and log details

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast and responsive API interactions, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN response time SHALL be under 2 seconds for standard operations
2. WHEN large datasets are requested THEN the system SHALL implement pagination with configurable page sizes
3. WHEN multiple concurrent requests occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without performance degradation
4. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback
5. IF system load is high THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting with appropriate error responses

### Requirement 10: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want proper access controls and secure data handling, so that sensitive information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access role-specific endpoints THEN the system SHALL enforce proper authorization
2. WHEN sensitive data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS and proper encryption
3. WHEN tokens are issued THEN they SHALL have appropriate expiration times and be securely generated
4. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL log all significant actions with user identification
5. IF security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL log incidents and take appropriate action

### Requirement 11: API Documentation and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation and testing capabilities, so that I can effectively integrate with and maintain the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL be documented with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
2. WHEN API changes are made THEN documentation SHALL be automatically updated
3. WHEN integration testing is needed THEN the system SHALL provide test endpoints and mock data
4. WHEN debugging is required THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and error tracking
5. IF API versions change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility or provide migration paths

### Requirement 12: Monitoring and Health Checks

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and health check capabilities, so that I can ensure system reliability and quickly identify issues.
