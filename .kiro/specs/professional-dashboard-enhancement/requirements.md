# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the comprehensive enhancement of the HR and Manager dashboard system for the hotel employee management platform. The current system provides basic functionality but lacks the professional polish, meaningful insights, and advanced features required for enterprise-grade hotel management operations. This enhancement will transform the existing dashboards into a sophisticated, data-driven management platform that provides actionable insights and streamlined workflows.

## Current System Analysis

### What Currently Works âœ…
