# Modular Employee Onboarding System - Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive, modular employee onboarding system for hotel properties. The system must digitize all 28 pages of the current paper onboarding packet while maintaining exact federal compliance for I-9, W-4, and other required forms.
