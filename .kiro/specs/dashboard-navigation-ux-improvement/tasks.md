- [ ] 7. Update Dashboard Tab Components
  - Convert existing tab components to route-based components
  - Remove tab-specific navigation logic from components
  - Update component props to work with routing
  - Ensure data loading works with new routing structure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 8. Implement Manager Dashboard Routing
  - Create manager-specific routes with proper URLs
  - Add manager role-based navigation restrictions
  - Implement manager dashboard layout with appropriate sections
  - Test manager navigation flow and permissions
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 9. Add Performance Optimizations
  - Implement route-level code splitting with React.lazy
  - Add data caching between route changes

- [ ] 11. Add Comprehensive Testing
  - Write unit tests for navigation components
  - Create integration tests for authentication flow
  - Test browser navigation functionality
  - Add tests for mobile responsiveness
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ] 12. Update Documentation and User Guide
  - Document new URL structure and navigation patterns
  - Create user guide for navigation features
  - Update development documentation for routing
  - Add troubleshooting guide for common navigation issues
  - _Requirements: All requirements documentation_

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. **High Priority**: Tasks 1-5 (Core routing and authentication)
2. **Medium Priority**: Tasks 6-8 (Error handling and component updates)
3. **Low Priority**: Tasks 9-12 (Optimizations and documentation)

### Dependencies
- Task 2 depends on Task 1 (layouts needed for routing)
- Task 4 depends on Task 2 (navigation needs routes)
- Task 7 depends on Tasks 2-4 (components need new structure)
- Task 8 depends on Tasks 1-5 (manager dashboard needs core system)

### Testing Strategy
- Test each task incrementally
- Verify browser navigation after each routing change
- Test authentication flow with each update
- Validate mobile responsiveness throughout

### Rollback Plan
- Keep current tab-based system as backup
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Test thoroughly in development before production
- Have rollback scripts ready for quick reversion
