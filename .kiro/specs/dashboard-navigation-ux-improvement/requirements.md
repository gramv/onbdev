# Dashboard Navigation & UX Improvement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical navigation and user experience issues in the HR and Manager dashboards. The current implementation uses tab-based navigation within a single route, causing poor UX with browser navigation and confusing user flows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Proper URL-Based Navigation

**User Story:** As an HR user, I want each dashboard section to have its own URL so that I can bookmark specific sections and use browser navigation properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to Properties section THEN the URL SHALL be `/hr/properties`
2. WHEN I navigate to Employees section THEN the URL SHALL be `/hr/employees`
3. WHEN I navigate to Applications section THEN the URL SHALL be `/hr/applications`
4. WHEN I navigate to Managers section THEN the URL SHALL be `/hr/managers`
5. WHEN I navigate to Analytics section THEN the URL SHALL be `/hr/analytics`
6. WHEN I access `/hr` directly THEN I SHALL be redirected to `/hr/properties` (default)

### Requirement 2: Browser Navigation Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the browser back/forward buttons to work correctly between dashboard sections so that navigation feels natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click browser back button from Employees section THEN I SHALL go to the previous dashboard section (not login)
2. WHEN I click browser forward button THEN I SHALL go to the next visited dashboard section
3. WHEN I refresh any dashboard section URL THEN I SHALL stay on that section (not redirect to login)
4. WHEN I bookmark a dashboard section URL THEN I SHALL be able to access it directly after authentication

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Authentication Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth authentication experience that doesn't interrupt my workflow when navigating between sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am authenticated and access any `/hr/*` route THEN I SHALL see the dashboard without additional login
2. WHEN I am not authenticated and access any `/hr/*` route THEN I SHALL be redirected to login with return URL
3. WHEN I login successfully THEN I SHALL be redirected to the originally requested URL or default dashboard
4. WHEN my session expires THEN I SHALL see a clear notification before being redirected to login

### Requirement 4: Navigation Breadcrumbs and Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual indicators of my current location and easy navigation between sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on any dashboard section THEN I SHALL see a breadcrumb showing current location
2. WHEN I am on a dashboard section THEN the corresponding tab SHALL be visually highlighted
3. WHEN I navigate between sections THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without full page reloads
4. WHEN I am on a dashboard section THEN I SHALL see the section name in the page title

### Requirement 5: Manager Dashboard Consistency

**User Story:** As a Manager user, I want the same navigation experience as HR users for my accessible sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate as Manager THEN I SHALL have URLs like `/manager/applications`, `/manager/employees`
2. WHEN I access manager sections THEN browser navigation SHALL work the same as HR dashboard
3. WHEN I am restricted from a section THEN I SHALL see appropriate access denied message
4. WHEN I bookmark manager URLs THEN they SHALL work correctly after authentication

### Requirement 6: Loading States and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during navigation and when errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between sections THEN I SHALL see appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN a section fails to load THEN I SHALL see a clear error message with retry option
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN I SHALL see specific error message and be redirected appropriately
4. WHEN accessing unauthorized sections THEN I SHALL see access denied message with navigation options

### Requirement 7: Mobile and Responsive Navigation

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want navigation to work smoothly across different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile device THEN navigation tabs SHALL be responsive and accessible
2. WHEN on small screens THEN navigation SHALL collapse appropriately
3. WHEN navigating on mobile THEN URLs and browser navigation SHALL work the same as desktop
4. WHEN using touch navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be appropriately sized

### Requirement 8: Performance and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast navigation between dashboard sections without unnecessary data reloading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between visited sections THEN data SHALL be cached appropriately
2. WHEN returning to a section THEN it SHALL load quickly without full refresh
3. WHEN navigating THEN only necessary API calls SHALL be made
4. WHEN data is stale THEN it SHALL be refreshed automatically in background
