# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current filtering interface in the Employees Directory takes up excessive vertical screen space, reducing the area available for displaying actual employee data. This feature will redesign the filtering UI to follow patterns used by major platforms like Amazon, Google, and LinkedIn, creating a more compact and space-efficient interface while maintaining all current functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an HR administrator or manager, I want a compact filtering interface that doesn't consume excessive screen space, so that I can see more employee data without scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Employees tab loads THEN the filtering interface SHALL occupy no more than 60px of vertical space (excluding advanced filters)
2. WHEN all basic filters are displayed THEN they SHALL be arranged horizontally in a single row
3. WHEN the interface is displayed THEN the search bar SHALL be the most prominent element with adequate width for typing
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN there SHALL be a subtle visual indicator showing active filters without taking additional space

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the filtering controls to be intuitive and follow familiar patterns from major platforms, so that I can quickly understand and use them without learning a new interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I see the search bar THEN it SHALL have a search icon and placeholder text similar to Amazon/Google patterns
2. WHEN I interact with filter dropdowns THEN they SHALL be compact with clear labels and appropriate widths
3. WHEN I need to sort results THEN the sort control SHALL combine field and direction in a single dropdown with intuitive labels
4. WHEN I want to clear filters THEN there SHALL be a single "Clear" action that resets all filters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on different screen sizes, I want the compact filtering interface to work responsively, so that I can use it effectively on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on desktop THEN all filter controls SHALL fit in a single horizontal row
2. WHEN viewed on tablet/mobile THEN filters SHALL wrap gracefully or scroll horizontally
3. WHEN screen space is limited THEN less critical filters SHALL be hidden behind an expandable menu
4. WHEN the interface adapts to screen size THEN functionality SHALL remain fully accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback on my filtering actions, so that I understand what filters are active and how many results are being shown.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filters are applied THEN the results count SHALL update immediately and be clearly visible
2. WHEN multiple filters are active THEN there SHALL be a subtle indicator showing "Filters active"
3. WHEN no filters are applied THEN the interface SHALL show the total count without filter indicators
4. WHEN I clear filters THEN all visual indicators SHALL reset immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to advanced filtering options when needed, so that I can perform complex searches without the advanced controls cluttering the main interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need advanced filters THEN they SHALL be accessible via a compact "Filters" button
2. WHEN advanced filters are opened THEN they SHALL appear as an overlay or expandable section
3. WHEN advanced filters are closed THEN they SHALL not consume any vertical space in the main interface
4. WHEN advanced filters are applied THEN their status SHALL be reflected in the main filter indicators
