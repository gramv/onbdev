# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a simplified MVP (Minimum Viable Product) onboarding system by connecting and streamlining existing functionality. The current system already has comprehensive job application submission, manager dashboards, onboarding flows, and document generation capabilities. The MVP will focus on connecting these components into a clean, working demo with a single property setup and fixing document generation issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Environment Setup and Database Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely migrate to a test environment, so that I can work on the MVP without affecting the production database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the test environment THEN the system SHALL backup current production .env configuration
2. WHEN updating environment variables THEN the system SHALL point to test database (https://kzommszdhapvqpekpvnt.supabase.co)
3. WHEN migrating database schema THEN the system SHALL create all existing tables in the test environment
4. WHEN verifying migration THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing functionality works with test database
5. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide easy rollback to production configuration

### Requirement 2: Single Property MVP Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the existing system for single property operation, so that the MVP is simplified and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the MVP THEN the system SHALL create one default property ("Grand Plaza Hotel")
2. WHEN applications are submitted THEN the system SHALL automatically assign them to the default property
3. WHEN manager logs in THEN the system SHALL show only applications for the default property
4. WHEN configuring users THEN the system SHALL assign the test manager to the default property
5. WHEN scaling later THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with multi-property functionality

### Requirement 3: Streamlined Job Application Flow

**User Story:** As a job candidate, I want to submit my application through the existing form, so that I can apply for positions at the hotel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing /apply/[property_id] THEN the system SHALL display the existing JobApplicationFormV2 component
2. WHEN submitting application THEN the system SHALL use existing submit_job_application endpoint
3. WHEN application is saved THEN the system SHALL store in test database with status 'pending'
4. WHEN submission succeeds THEN the system SHALL show confirmation with application ID
5. WHEN submission fails THEN the system SHALL display existing error handling

### Requirement 4: Manager Dashboard Integration

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want to use the existing dashboard to review applications, so that I can approve or reject candidates efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN manager logs in THEN the system SHALL display existing EnhancedManagerDashboard
2. WHEN viewing applications THEN the system SHALL show pending applications from test database
3. WHEN clicking approve THEN the system SHALL use existing approve_application endpoint
4. WHEN clicking reject THEN the system SHALL use existing rejection functionality
5. WHEN status changes THEN the system SHALL trigger existing onboarding initiation for approved applications

### Requirement 5: Onboarding Flow Connection

**User Story:** As an approved candidate, I want to receive an onboarding link and complete the existing onboarding process, so that I can finish my employment documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application is approved THEN the system SHALL use existing OnboardingOrchestrator to create session
2. WHEN onboarding session is created THEN the system SHALL send email using existing email_service
3. WHEN candidate clicks link THEN the system SHALL use existing OnboardingFlowPortal
4. WHEN onboarding progresses THEN the system SHALL use existing step components and controllers
5. WHEN onboarding completes THEN the system SHALL update employee status using existing functionality

### Requirement 6: Document Generation System Fix

**User Story:** As an employee completing onboarding, I want all required documents to be generated accurately, so that I can complete my employment requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating company policies THEN the system SHALL fix PolicyDocumentGenerator to create accurate documents
2. WHEN generating I9 form THEN the system SHALL ensure existing I9 PDF generation works correctly
3. WHEN generating W4 form THEN the system SHALL ensure existing W4 PDF generation works correctly
4. WHEN generating direct deposit form THEN the system SHALL fix DirectDepositForm PDF generation
5. WHEN generating insurance forms THEN the system SHALL fix HealthInsuranceForm PDF generation
6. WHEN documents are generated THEN the system SHALL store using existing DocumentStorageService
7. WHEN document generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 7: Manager Document Review Enhancement

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want to view all generated documents through the existing dashboard, so that I can ensure compliance and completeness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN manager accesses employee records THEN the system SHALL display documents using existing UI components
2. WHEN viewing documents THEN the system SHALL use existing PDFViewer components
3. WHEN documents are missing THEN the system SHALL highlight issues in existing dashboard
4. WHEN I9 Section 2 is needed THEN the system SHALL use existing I9Section2Form component
5. WHEN all documents are complete THEN the system SHALL mark onboarding as finished using existing workflow

### Requirement 8: Authentication and User Management

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to use the existing authentication system, so that I can securely access the appropriate features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging in THEN the system SHALL use existing login endpoint with test database
2. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL use existing JWT token system
3. WHEN accessing protected routes THEN the system SHALL use existing ProtectedRoute components

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use existing error handling and display mechanisms
2. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL use existing skeleton loaders and loading states
3. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL use existing validation and feedback systems
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL use existing routing and breadcrumb systems
5. WHEN real-time updates happen THEN the system SHALL use existing WebSocket functionality

### Requirement 10: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the MVP works correctly, so that it can serve as a reliable demonstration system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the application flow THEN the system SHALL complete end-to-end job application submission
2. WHEN testing manager approval THEN the system SHALL successfully approve applications and trigger onboarding
3. WHEN testing onboarding flow THEN the system SHALL complete all steps and generate documents
