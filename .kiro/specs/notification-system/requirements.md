3. WHEN a manager logs into their dashboard THEN the system SHALL show a count of pending applications in the Applications tab
4. WHEN a new application is submitted THEN the notification SHALL include candidate name, position applied for, and submission timestamp
5. IF no manager is assigned to the property THEN the system SHALL send the notification to HR administrators
