# Hotel Employee Onboarding System - Modular Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive plan for implementing a government-compliant hotel employee onboarding system with **MODULAR ARCHITECTURE** for individual form updates. The system digitizes all 28 pages of the current paper onboarding packet while maintaining exact federal compliance for I-9, W-4, and other required forms.

**CRITICAL APPROACH**: Build one beautiful page at a time, test it thoroughly, then move to the next. Each form component must be completely modular so HR can send individual forms to employees for updates (W-4 changes, emergency contacts, etc.) without requiring full onboarding.

## Current Status
✅ **Completed:**
- JWT-based secure onboarding token system
- Basic PDF generation infrastructure 
- Manager review and approval workflow
- Official government form downloads (I-9, W-4)
- Health insurance cost configuration from packet
- Fixed step component prop structure (WelcomeStep, PersonalInfoStep, I9Section1Step)
- Created autoFillManager utility for consistent data management

🚧 **Currently Building:**
- **ONLY the BEST WELCOME PAGE** - Beautiful, standalone welcome page
- Connected to job application approval showing motel/property name
- **FOCUS**: Build ONE perfect welcome page, nothing else

**CRITICAL**: Do not build flows, navigation, or multiple pages. ONLY the welcome page.

## Current Task: Perfect Welcome Page

### What we're building:
- **Single beautiful welcome page** that shows when manager approves application
- Displays approved motel/property name prominently
- Shows employee details from approval
- Professional design with company branding
- Multi-language support (English/Spanish)
- "Begin Onboarding" button to start process later

### Requirements:
- Must show property name from manager approval
- Must be modular (standalone component)
- Must be beautiful and professional
- Must connect to existing job application workflow
- Must work independently without complex flows

## Modular Form Update Architecture

### Individual Form Updates
The system supports sending individual forms to employees for updates at any time:

**Use Cases:**
- Employee gets married → HR sends W-4 update form
- Employee moves → HR sends Personal Information update form  
- Employee has new baby → HR sends Health Insurance update form
- Emergency contact changes → HR sends Emergency Contact update form

**Architecture:**
- Each form component is completely standalone
- Forms can be accessed via unique secure URLs: `/update-form/{form-type}/{employee-token}`
- All forms use the same prop structure and validation system
- Updates are saved directly to employee record without affecting other information
- Digital signatures captured for all updates with legal compliance metadata

**Supported Individual Forms:**
- `w4-update` - W-4 Employee's Withholding Certificate
- `personal-info-update` - Personal Information & Emergency Contacts
- `health-insurance-update` - Health Insurance Plan Changes
- `direct-deposit-update` - Banking Information Updates
- `emergency-contacts-update` - Emergency Contact Information Only
