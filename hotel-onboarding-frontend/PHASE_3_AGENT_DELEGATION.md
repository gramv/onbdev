## Coordination Notes

### Parallel Execution
All 7 agents can work simultaneously as each step is independent. However, maintain consistency in:
- Using the same design system
- Similar animation patterns
- Consistent validation messaging
- Uniform spacing and layout principles

### Shared Components
If any agent needs a component not in the enhanced library, document it for potential shared use:
- DatePicker
- PhoneInput
- AddressAutocomplete
- SkillTagSelector
- AvailabilityGrid

### Communication
Each agent should:
1. Start by reading this document section
2. Review the design system files
3. Check the enhanced components
4. Begin implementation
5. Test thoroughly
6. Mark complete when done

## Success Criteria
- All 7 forms redesigned with enhanced components
- Professional UX matching top job platforms
- Mobile responsive design
- Federal compliance maintained
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Comprehensive validation
- Accessibility compliant
- Performance optimized
